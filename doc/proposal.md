## Overview

<br/>

> ### Because of **COVID-19**, Non face-to-face online classes have continued since 2020. And there is no confirmation when the situation will end. So, the **Smart campus** has become more important than in the past. For smoother online classes, we suggest additional functionality of smart campus that students may need.  
<br/>

> ### If you pick the most important thing in your life, **time-management** will be one of them. For appropriate time management, it is necessary to organize an appropriate **Calender**. Additional functions are needed to listen to lectures, to do assignments or to proceed team project efficiently and uniformly.
<br/>

## Previous functionality

<br/>

> ### Traditional calendars are posted without distinction between lectures and assignments, and only on deadlines for lectures and assignments. As shown in the example image below, this type of calender is hard to recognize, looks messy, and is very difficult to use to manage real schedule.
<br/><br/>

![example_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65070885/113131569-58d40780-9258-11eb-9ca8-f970797334cf.png)


<br/>

> ### In fact, study objects tied up on Sundays are **more than twice** in the example_image above because the deadline for attendance is Sunday. At a glance, you can feel that the **visuality** and **convenience** of this are not very good. So we suggest additional functionality to get **high efficiency, convenience, etc**.
<br/>

## Goals

    * Personal Custom Calendar
    * Sharing calendars with groups
    * Applying alarm push linked with LearningX



<br/>

### 1. Personal Custom Calendar
</br>

> ### Before adding other functions, it is necessary to create a calendar to apply them. So we propose a personal custom function that **adds classes, assignments, or other personal custom tasks** to the calendar as an object.
<br/>

![custom_object](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65070885/113131658-71dcb880-9258-11eb-9215-6118f8f2ce16.png)

<br/>

> ### If we can make or choose object like this, next thing to do is making calendar by posting these objects.
<br/>

![custom_schedule](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65070885/113131677-7903c680-9258-11eb-8395-5c48ec74067f.png)
<br/>

> ### By assigning the objects shown above, a completely new custom calendar can be created. And if we can store **multiple of these custom calendars**, students will be able to conveniently manage the schedules for different purposes.
<br/>

### 2. Sharing common Calendars with groups
<br/>

> ### In everytime application, there is a function that sharing each person's calendar with themselves. To expand this, sharing the permission to modify the contents of a common calendar will allow us to manage the schedule of group activities such as team projects more efficiently like **github**. It is already used by make a common plan in github, but in Icampus, we can make a better calendar by using Icampus resources.
<br/>

### 3. Applying alarm push linked with LearningX
<br/>

> ### There is already a function to push the alarm to mobile device when lectures, assignments, and notices are posted on campus by LearningX. 
<br/>

![alarm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65070885/113131716-86b94c00-9258-11eb-9b84-b04b79511ae7.png)

> ### If such an alarm push can be set on a custom calendar, side effects such as failing to comply with time within the group sharing the calendar can be minimized.
